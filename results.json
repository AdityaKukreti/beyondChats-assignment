Often, the presence of a few pus cells on a semen analysis report could be misinterpreted as an infection when they are actually immature sperm precursors. It's important to consult with a specialist who can accurately interpret the results before starting any treatment.": [

                "context": "Pus cells in the semen - and how to make sense of the report One of the common findings in a semen analysis report is the presence of a few pus cells per high power field ( pus cells/ hpf). The technical word for this is called pyospermia or leucocytospermia. Pus cells are WBCs - white blood cells, and less than 5 pus cells / hpf is considered to be normal, but this finding is often highlighted in red as being abnormal, and this often causes both the doctor as well as the patient to worry.The WHO Manual states that less than 1 million WBC per ml is normal, but the majority of labs never bother to measure the actual concentration of the WBCs - the technician simply eyeballs the sample and estimate this in terms of rounds cells seen in each visual field when scanning the samples through the microscope. Patients are worried that these pus cells suggest they are suffering from an occult infection - perhaps a sexually transmitted disease ( STD) which they knew they had acquired in the past, and they are worried that they can transmit this to their wife.They are also worried that this hidden infection can kill their sperm, or reduce their ability to fertilise the eggs.Doctors are also happy to \"treat\" this abnormality by putting the man on antibiotics, because these are so easy to prescribe, and because this seems to be a logical thing to do. They hope these antibiotics will kill the bugs causing the infection, and this will boost the man's fertility. The reason this is flawed logic is because the \"pus cells\" seen on a semen analysis report when checked through the microscope are simply round cells, which are misinterpreted as being pus cells .When examining the semen under the microscope, it's very easy to identify sperm because they have a tail and are moving rapidly. However, seminal fluid also contains many other cells, including the epithelial cells which line the male reproductive tract, as well as sperm precursor cells. Most laboratory technicians will report every round cell they see as a pus cell or a WBC , but most of these are actually immature sperm precursors, called spermatocytes or spermatogonia , which look exactly the same. However, most labs don't have the special stains needed to identify whether this round cell is a WBC or not , which is why they will report all the round cells as pus cells !The doctor then promptly prescribes antibiotics, but this is a complete waste, because there was no infection in the first place, and antibiotics will not cause the sperm precursor cells to go away !Patients end up wasting a lot of time and money on taking antibiotics . Some doctors will also send the semen sample to the microbiology lab to try to culture the microbe causing the purported infection. ",

An electronic portfolio is not mandatory for revalidation, offering flexibility in the choice of format.\n\nRecommendations for Portfolio: It is recommended that the portfolio includes all core elements required by the GMC. The suggested format is professionally presented, typed for legibility, and capable of electronic transmission.\n\nConfidentiality of Supporting Information: Certain supporting information, such as original complaint letters and handwritten complement cards, is recommended to be kept in paper form and shared privately with the appraiser to maintain confidentiality. These can then be referenced anonymously in the summary.\n\nMedical Appraisal Guide Model Form: The Medical Appraisal Guide model form by NHS England is highlighted as a free interactive PDF available from the NHS England website. It serves as a template for all other toolkit providers, with its use not restricted to England alone.\n\nNational Platforms in Scotland and Wales: In Scotland and Wales, national appraisal and revalidation platforms (SOAR in Scotland and MARS in Wales) are mentioned, providing a standardized approach for all doctors.\n\nResponsibility of Responsible Officers (ROs): Responsible officers may express a preference among available options, and doctors are encouraged to check with designated body requirements and variations. Special arrangements might be needed for accessibility issues related to a protected characteristic.\n\nMoving to a New Area: When relocating to a new area in the UK, it is advised to check if a preferred local choice of the portfolio is being used.\n\nPortfolio Accessibility: Doctors are reminded that the portfolio, containing all GMC-required supporting information, should be available to the responsible officer potentially at short notice.",

As the above makes clear, your RO has the discretion to consider supporting information from other settings in making their revalidation recommendation.\nEven in UK practice, you may attend CPD events overseas. It is appropriate to check that the content of such an event is applicable to your scope of practice rather than assuming that it will be acceptable. We recommend that you discuss any proposal to include any such additional supporting information with your RO in advance of your revalidation recommendation date. It is likely that clinical work overseas will have a significant overlap with clinical work in the UK. It may well be appropriate to include supporting information relating to work overseas when it demonstrates the quality of your reflective practice.\nIf you are unsure, use your appraisal as an opportunity to reflect on what is appropriate and proportionate with your appraiser, and then agree it with your RO before your revalidation recommendation is due. Content from: Mythbusters@RCGP\n \n*Key Insights:*\n*Common Query Addressed:*\n- The video addresses a common question among appraisees: whether they can include supporting information from non-UK sources in their appraisal.\n*Source of Content:*\n- The information in the video is derived from Mythbusters at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), emphasizing the reliability of the content.\n*Practice Settings Abroad:*\n- Doctors practicing overseas, where a UK license is not required, have the discretion to include supporting information from these settings. It's at their judgment whether such information is relevant to their scope of practice.\n*GMC Requirements:*\n- The General Medical Council (GMC) requires that the appraisal and revalidation portfolio include supporting information for every aspect of the scope of practice requiring a UK license.\n*Discretion in Considering Information:*\n- The Responsible Officer (RO) has the discretion to consider supporting information from non-UK settings when making revalidation recommendations. However, it is crucial to ensure that the content is applicable to the scope of practice.\n*Communication with RO:*\n- Doctors are encouraged to discuss any proposal to include additional supporting information from non-UK settings with their Responsible Officer before the revalidation recommendation date.\n*Overlap with UK Clinical Work:*\n- Clinical work overseas may overlap significantly with work in the UK. In such cases, it might be appropriate to include supporting information related to overseas work, particularly if it demonstrates the quality of reflective practice.\n*Reflective Practice:*\n- The video suggests using the appraisal as an opportunity to reflect on what supporting information is appropriate and proportionate.

                "context": "Are Certificates Of Attendance At CPD Events Important For A Medical Appraisal?\nCertificates of attendance may prove attendance at an event, but they are not proof of learning or development. They say nothing about what has been learned, or any changes you have made as a result.\nA reflective note, no matter how brief, is far more valuable evidence of reflective practice and continuing professional development than a certificate. A lot of valuable learning takes place in ways that do not\ngenerate a certificate, such as personal reading and professional conversations with colleagues. We encourage you to think about how and what you have learnt, defining one CPD credit as one hour of learning activity as demonstrated by a reflective note on the lessons learned and any changes made as a result.\nYou should not waste time scanning certificates of attendance into your portfolio of supporting information, unless keeping formal proof of attendance on courses that are organisational requirements may be useful\nto you, such as Basic Life Support and Safeguarding. Appraisers should not be asking to see certificates of attendance; they should be asking what your most important new learning has been over the past year and what difference it has made to your practice.\nMany CPD facilitators now provide certificates that include a structured format or template for you to write appropriate reflective notes about learning and planned changes that will have an impact on your practice.\nIt is reasonable to scan these rather than rewriting the reflective note elsewhere. You can also choose not to complete the certificate at all if the reflective note is captured elsewhere in a learning log or electronic\ntoolkit. Your aim should be to avoid duplication of effort.\n\nkey insight : from the provided information on Medical Appraisals in the UK is that certificates of attendance at Continuing Professional Development (CPD) events are considered proof of attendance but not sufficient evidence of learning or development. The video emphasizes that merely attending an event does not convey what has been learned or the impact on one's practice. Instead, the focus is on the importance of reflective practice, encouraging appraisers to provide reflective notes as more valuable evidence of CPD.\n\nThe video suggests that a brief reflective note is far more valuable than a certificate, as it demonstrates the individual's understanding of what was learned and any changes made as a result. The emphasis is on capturing the essence of the learning experience and its application to professional development. The content discourages the unnecessary inclusion of certificates of attendance in the appraisal portfolio unless required by the organization for specific courses.\n\nAppraisers are advised to ask about the most significant new learning over the past year and its impact on practice, shifting the focus from proof of attendance to the meaningful outcomes of the learning process. Many CPD facilitators now provide certificates with structured formats or templates for writing reflective notes, making it reasonable to include these in the portfolio.",

However, the responsibility to engage with the annual appraisal process lies with the individual doctor.\n*Ongoing Engagement:*\n- Ongoing engagement with the annual appraisal process is highlighted as the doctor's responsibility, emphasizing the need for proactive participation.\n*Organizing Appraisal Without RO:*\n- In cases where doctors do not have an RO or a suitable person, they are encouraged to organize an annual appraisal that meets GMC criteria for revalidation.\n*Designated Body's Appraisal Policy:*\n- For those working in designated bodies with organizational appraisal policies, doctors are urged to understand the policies and know how to access their annual appraisal.\n*Proactive Approach:*\n- Doctors are advised to be proactive in ensuring they have a meaningful annual appraisal that aligns with their professional and developmental needs within their specific working context.\n*Seeking Advice:*\n- If a doctor believes they should be offered an appraisal and are not, they are encouraged to seek advice from their designated body and take proactive steps to be included in the appraisal process.\n*Role in Highlighting Errors:*\n- Doctors are regarded as best placed to highlight administrative errors in the appraisal process, emphasizing their active role in the process.",

This involves ensuring that the documentation complies with the requirements for revalidation.\nRO's Statutory Responsibility: The RO holds the statutory responsibility for making the revalidation recommendation to the General Medical Council (GMC). The RO's decision is based on factors such as the doctor's engagement in annual appraisal, the quality of the supporting information portfolio, and any outstanding concerns within the scope of work.\nGMC Revalidation Decision: Ultimately, the GMC makes the revalidation decision, determining whether to continue the doctor's license to practice.\nAppraiser as a Resource: While the appraiser does not make the revalidation decision, they are a valuable resource in helping doctors improve the quality of documentation, especially in areas such as the quality of reflection and the relevance of supporting information across the entire scope of work.\nImportance of Engagement: The video highlights that insufficient engagement is often related to the quality of reflection and the relevance of supporting information across the entire scope of work.\nProfessional Development Planning: Appraisers can support doctors in planning their professional development in a way that enhances the quality of their professional work.",

They can be healthcare providers, organizations setting healthcare standards and policies, or certain specialized organizations employing or contracting with doctors.\n\nResponsible Officer (RO): The majority of designated bodies have a Responsible Officer (RO) in place. RO is an important figure in the revalidation process and is responsible for overseeing the appraisal and revalidation of doctors within the designated body.\n\nPrescribed Connection: Each doctor can have only one prescribed connection to a designated body. In most cases, this prescribed connection is where the doctor performs the majority of their clinical work.\n\nIdentifying Designated Body and RO: Doctors can identify their designated body and RO by setting up a GMC (General Medical Council) online account. The GMC website provides a full list of designated bodies, and doctors can use an online tool under the revalidation section to confirm their designated body.\n\nEmployment and Prescribed Link: If a doctor is employed by an NHS organization but works for another organization through contracted sessions, their prescribed link will be to the NHS organization and its RO, regardless of the time spent outside.\n\nConfirmation of Designated Body: Once the designated body is confirmed, the RO should assist the doctor in identifying a suitable appraiser for the revalidation process.\n\nNo Designated Body Connection: If a doctor doesn't have a connection to any organization classified as a designated body, they should inform the GMC about their circumstances using their online account.\n\nFinding a Responsible Officer: In cases where a responsible officer cannot be found, it may be possible to identify a suitable person. The GMC website provides more information and guidance on this.",

Designated bodies play a pivotal role in facilitating the revalidation process, overseeing the appraisal and performance assessment of doctors, and upholding standards of excellence in medical practice. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, according to the Responsible Officer Regulations, a designated body is typically an organization or institution that employs or contracts with doctors and is responsible for the following:\n\n1. Appointing responsible officers: Designated bodies appoint responsible officers who oversee the appraisal and revalidation of doctors within their organization.\n\n2. Supporting appraisal and revalidation: Designated bodies provide support and resources for doctors to undergo appraisal, which involves regular assessment of their performance and professional development. They also facilitate the revalidation process, which is the periodic evaluation of doctors' fitness to practice.\n\n3. Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements: Designated bodies ensure that doctors meet the necessary standards of competence, conduct, and professionalism required by regulatory authorities such as the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK.\n\nDesignated bodies in the context of Responsible Officer Regulations are typically healthcare organizations, including hospitals, general practitioner (GP) practices, and other healthcare institutions where doctors work.

Your responsible officer (RO) has a duty to ensure that there is a suitable, quality assured, appraisal process for you to participate in. The GMC requires you to engage with your annual appraisal process on an ongoing basis. Some doctors do not have an RO, or a Suitable Person, and still organise their own annual appraisal that meets the GMC criteria for a medical appraisal for revalidation.\nIf you work in a designated body with an organisational appraisal policy, it is your responsibility to understand what that means for you and how you should be accessing your annual appraisal. Your RO has a statutory responsibility for ensuring that the appraisal process is fit for purpose but you must play your part in engaging fully with the process.\nWe recommend that you are proactive in ensuring that you have an annual appraisal that is meaningful and meets your personal and professional development needs in the context in which you work. If your appraisal becomes disproportionately burdensome, we recommend that you speak to your appraiser and RO. They can support you and make recommendations.\nIf you think that you should be offered an appraisal and you are not, we recommend that you are proactive about seeking advice from your designated body and ensuring that you are included in the appraisal\nprocess. Administrative errors do happen and you are best placed to highlight such omissions.\n",

This is why IVF patients are often completely confused about what to expect. Actually , it's very straightforward and logical, and if you understand this simple framework , you will be able to make sure your doctor's doing the right stuff for you. Remember that all we are doing in an IVF cycle is replicating what should have happened normally in the fallopian tubes - the only difference is that we are doing this in the test tube ! 1. First is the pre-IVF testing, or the workup. These are simple tests, to make sure whether IVF is the right treatment for you; and what kind of IVF you require ( for example, if this should be IVF or ICSI).(a). semen analysis for your husband ( to check his sperm count and motility); (b) blood tests for you for the following reproductive hormones - FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone),LH ( luteinising hormone),PRL ( prolactin) , AMH ( anti-Mullerian hormone) and TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone) on Day 3 of your cycle, ( to check the quality of your eggs). (c) A vaginal ultrasound scan on Day 10 or 11 which should check for a. ovarian volume; b. antral follicle count; c. uterus morphology; d. endometrial thickness and texture, to confirm your uterus is normal. If there is a problem, then this can be treated prior to starting IVF! 2. Second is the stage of superovulation , where the doctor gives you hormonal injections in order to help you to grow lots of eggs. The growth of the follicles is monitored using vaginal ultra sound scans and blood estradiol levels. 3. The third step is that of egg collection ( egg retrieval) , where he collects the eggs from your mature follicles, and sends them to the embryologist in the IVF lab, where they are placed in culture medium. 4. Then comes fertilization, where either using IVF or ICSI, the embryologist adds sperm to the egg. 5. Then is the process of embryo culture, where the embryos are grown in the IVF laboratory in the incubator, so they divide and grow , till they form blastocysts. 6. This is followed by embryo transfer, where the embryos are put back in the uterus with the hope that they will implant. 7. The final step is that of cryopreservation (freezing for storage) where the extra embryos can be frozen in liquid nitrogen , so that they can be used for future attempts. This ensures nothing is wasted or thrown away.",

What additional expertise can this investor bring to the table? 2. Who can this investor introduce and connect me to? 3. How solvent and \\ufb02ush is this investor? 4. Is this investor looking to create shared success, or just take all they can? 5. Do we share the same values and level of integrity?",

Not in a demanding manner, but as a matter of fact - as an entrepreneur, you deserve to know this. The key is not to select the investor that gives the best answer, it is to select someone who is honest and trustworthy. You want to be on the same page regarding the contribution of people that have the privilege of sitting on your cap table.Some softer guidelinesToo many cooks will spoil the brothThe fewer investors, the better. If investors come in as a group, please ensure you are dealing with just one nominee. It is very easy to run around like a headless chicken when there are multiple investors seeking your bandwidth in diverse and opposite directions. This is the shortest route to a catastrophe.Familiarity is your best betVenture capitalists that have been former entrepreneurs will always be the better investor than a finance guy! Not only will you find more empathy from them, but they will also be more humble than a number-crunching excel gymnast that has not been in the trenches before!Fund vs IndividualThis is a personal choice. An individual investor or family office will be far more flexible and have a longer horizon than a VC fund. However, a VC fund \"should\" ideally be able to offer far more support.Closing commentsPeople are investing to get a return. Do expect hard negotiation on entry valuations, and rights. But in all the cold hard numbers and facts, please remember to look for 'heart'. If the investor only desires to earn money from this engagement without the urge to create a long-lasting business, walk away. Entrepreneurship, like marriage, is a long and difficult journey with many ups and downs.Find someone you also want to wake up to, not just someone you want to go to bed with.",

They use a mindless checklist approach - which can drain quite a bit of blood - and money ! Many of these tests are pointless, because they provide little useful information. However, this seems to be the norm, especially in large IVF centers ( which are run as mills and employ a huge number of doctors); as well as in the US, where testing is often done for non-medical reasons.We prefer taking a simplified, patient-friendly approach by focusing on what is medially important. We customize this testing, depending upon the patient. In order to do IVF, remember that we only need to check the following: eggs; sperm; uterus and tubes.We usually do just the following simple medical tests before starting an IVF cycle. If the tests have been done in the past one year, there is no need to repeat them.For the husband, all we need is a simple semen analysis ( www.drmalpani.com/semen-analysis.htm) , to check sperm count , motility and morphology.a. If it's normal, then we plan to do IVF.b. If it's abnormal, then we plan to do ICSI. If there is an element of doubt ( for example, if the counts vary a lot), then ICSI is a safer option, as fertilization is guaranteedc. If it's zero, then we need to consider sperm retrieval through TESE or PESAThe wife needs more extensive testing.1. blood tests for the following reproductive hormones : FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone),LH ( luteinising hormone),PRL ( prolactin) and TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone) on Day 3 of the cycle, ( to check the quality of the eggs). This needs to be done from a reliable lab such as Specialty Ranbaxy ( www.srl.in). If these tests are normal, then the standard superovulation regimen can be followed . However, if there is a problem, then this will need to be corrected.a. A high prolactin ( www.drmalpani.com/prolactin.htm) can be corrected by treatment with bromocriptine or cabergolineb.

This is why IVF patients are often completely confused about what to expect. Actually , it's very straightforward and logical, and if you understand this simple framework , you will be able to make sure your doctor's doing the right stuff for you. Remember that all we are doing in an IVF cycle is replicating what should have happened normally in the fallopian tubes - the only difference is that we are doing this in the test tube ! 1. First is the pre-IVF testing, or the workup. These are simple tests, to make sure whether IVF is the right treatment for you; and what kind of IVF you require ( for example, if this should be IVF or ICSI).(a). semen analysis for your husband ( to check his sperm count and motility); (b) blood tests for you for the following reproductive hormones - FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone),LH ( luteinising hormone),PRL ( prolactin) , AMH ( anti-Mullerian hormone) and TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone) on Day 3 of your cycle, ( to check the quality of your eggs). (c) A vaginal ultrasound scan on Day 10 or 11 which should check for a. ovarian volume; b. antral follicle count; c. uterus morphology; d. endometrial thickness and texture, to confirm your uterus is normal. If there is a problem, then this can be treated prior to starting IVF! 2. Second is the stage of superovulation , where the doctor gives you hormonal injections in order to help you to grow lots of eggs. The growth of the follicles is monitored using vaginal ultra sound scans and blood estradiol levels. 3. The third step is that of egg collection ( egg retrieval) , where he collects the eggs from your mature follicles, and sends them to the embryologist in the IVF lab, where they are placed in culture medium. 4. Then comes fertilization, where either using IVF or ICSI, the embryologist adds sperm to the egg. 5. Then is the process of embryo culture, where the embryos are grown in the IVF laboratory in the incubator, so they divide and grow , till they form blastocysts. 6. This is followed by embryo transfer, where the embryos are put back in the uterus with the hope that they will implant. 7. The final step is that of cryopreservation (freezing for storage) where the extra embryos can be frozen in liquid nitrogen , so that they can be used for future attempts. This ensures nothing is wasted or thrown away.",
